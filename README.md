**Key motivation:** *Tracking both location and pose of multiple planar objects (MPOT) is of great significance to numerous real-world applications, including industrial, education, geometric, art, and our daily life.*
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

This repository contains the official implementation of our work in ICCV 2023. **MPOT-3K** dataset and the pytorch training/validation code for **tracking framework PRTrack** are released. More details can be viewed in our paper.
